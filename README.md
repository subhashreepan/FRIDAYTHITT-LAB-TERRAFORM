# FRIDAYTHITT-LAB-TERRAFORM
A practical lab converting an AWS CloudFormation template into a modular Terraform setup. It includes a VPC, subnets, routing, security groups, and EC2 instances, structured into reusable modules with core files for integration. Issues like variable scoping and AWS credentials were resolved to ensure functionality.
